# CosmoDensities
Calculate density of various cosmological components over the history of the universe.

As the universe expands and cools, the energy density of its various constiuents changes.  The energy density of matter, which is non-relativistic, dilutes with the scale factor of the universe _a_ cubed, i.e., with the volume of the universe.  There's only so much matter, and as the universe gets bigger it becomes more dilute.

Relativistic particles like photons, also dilute with volume but they also redshift, losing some energy as their wavelength stretches with the expansion of the universe.  So the energy density of relativistic particles drops with the scale factor to the fourth power.

Neutrinos, very light particles, were relativistic at early times and evolved like photons, but later became non-relativistic and now evolve like regular matter.  However, since we don't know how massive neutrinos actually are, we can plot a few options to see when in the history of the universe neutrinos transition.

Finally, there is a proposed vacuum energy density, the Cosmological constant (Lambda), which is the energy inherently in empty space.  We don't know what this is, but assuming a component like this exists in the universe brings a lot of disparate observations together into one cohesive whole.  Since this component is a constant, inherent value of empty space, it's density does not evolve with time.  Since the energy densitites of other constituents of the universe are constantly decreasing, this means the Cosmological constant fills a larger and larger fraction of the energy content of the universe.
